            To access the Upper Town, in addition to taxis, buses, numerous stairs and a scenic trail lasting about ten minutes, you can take the funicular, created in 1887 and thanks to which you can pass through the Venetian walls and get to the heart of the medieval part of Bergamo, right into one of the many historic squares of the upper town.
